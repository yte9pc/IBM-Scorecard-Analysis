Law Codes

   covers the administration of the United States 
   federal student financial aid programs." - Wikipedia

Identifiers
===========

OPEID = OPE's ID for an institution
    "This is a 6-digit number and is also provided as an 8-digit number with a 2-digit 
    suffix to identify branches, additional locations, and other entities that are part of 
    the eligible institution." - ScoreCard Data Documentation
    
UNITID = IPEDS IDs
    Identifiers in the IPEDS (= a data system).


Crosswalk = Effort by college scorecard to correlate OPE and IPEDS identifiers.

    "The Scorecard universe of institutions excludes non-Title IV institutions 
    without a valid OPEID, those that do not report data to IPEDS on 
    degree/certificate completions, and those that do not report enrollment 
    data to IPEDS.3 For more information about IPEDS, please see 
    http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds."


    "There is not necessarily a one-to-one relationship between UNITID and the 
    8-digit OPEID. A UNITID may correspond to the aggregation of several OPEIDs 
    (i.e., several locations of an institution combining their data for IPEDS reporting),
    or in rarer cases may correspond to part of an OPEID (e.g., a single location may
    elect to report their traditional campus-based and online operations under separate
    UNITIDs despite both being part of the same OPEID)."
