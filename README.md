# Predicting Income and Attrition : An analysis of the IBM HR Analytics Employee datasetls.
 
We worked with the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset. The data consider both professional (e.g., job performance) and personal (e.g., marital status) features. We were interested in answering two specific questions:
- How can we predict monthly income?
- How can we predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company?
