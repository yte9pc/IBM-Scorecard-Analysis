=======================================================

Data set.

The general kinds of questions that interest us.

We expect to answer only one or two questions, though we start with a larger
list to pick from as we investigate the data.


Categories:

Sample questions by category:

 Category A:

Final report
=======================================================
Lay summary : 2 pages
Detailed description: 

The entire report should be no more than 10 pages double spaced.

Probable 1 or 2 questions.

=======================================================


We will limit down the data.

Linear models
1. Earnings

   As an incoming student, when is the program worth it despite the incurred debt?
   In other words, when will it increase my earnings outcome over some X period of time
   so that it balances out the debt.
   
   A) At what year X after graduation do we predict that debt will paid off?
   
   B) At what year X after graduation do we predict mean assets will exceed if had not 
   enrolled?  (compare to median wages or something of non-college-educated work force)
   
    
   years_to_pay_off ~ program_enrolled + college_enrolled_category + cost_program
                                           ^---- group them somehow
                        + grants
   
   C) How much is earning potential after completion?                                  
   
   ==> What fields correlate with fast or slow repayments.
   
2. Completion

    A) Can we predict the likely completion of a student?  (individual - Bernoulli?)
    B) Can we predict the likely completion rate of a cohort? (aggregate)

    individual
    completion ~ income_bracket + work_part_time + first_generation + ...
    [completed / not completed = logistic]

    [linear/logistic]
    completion_rate ~ ...
    [possible threshold]

3. Change in enrollment in programs

   A) How is the amount of enrollment in a program changing over time?
      For example, are CS / Data Science majors being flooded? 
      
      
      degree ~ year + program + school description

4. Demographics

    A) does the makup of first-generation students change over time?
    B) how many women are studying STEM over time?

Descriptive Statistics
1. Which field of college creates the most debt?
